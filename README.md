# BittrexCryptoTrader
Simple cryptocurrency trading on the bittrex exchange built with python

I wrote the a year or two before publishing. I had learned basic Python syntax and needed a project to explore and expand my skills.

The code here is very rough. Some elements from this project were reused in a my other repository, ParallelizedAlgorithmicTrader, which is much more advanced and clean.
